# DBSCAN-Mall_Customers-Data
This project applies the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to the Mall Customers dataset.
The goal is to group customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score, identifying natural clusters and outliers without prior knowledge of the number of groups.

 Tools & Libraries :

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

 Key Concepts :

Density-based clustering

Detecting outliers (noise points)

Parameter tuning for eps and min_samples

Visualizing clusters in 2D

 Results:

Clear visualization of customer clusters

Detection of isolated customers (outliers)

Comparison with K-Means results
